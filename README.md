I created a simple recipe finder using spoonacular API and React JS framework.
It simply allow users to enter food name and the app automatically displays 10 recipes related to what the user searched.

Each recipes provides an image of the recipe, title, and the link. The link takes the user to recipe card page where user can see the picture, title, preparation time, and the link to the original recipe. 

In addition, there is a "Go back" button to go back to the search page.
